# Distributed tracing in Golang

![](/trace.png)

This repository contains sample k8s cluster config and golang apps to try distributed tracing with GCP [Stackdriver trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/). This is just sample for me. You can fork this repositry and modify it like you want (So don't need to send PR).

To create k8s cluster for this,

```bash
$ ./cluster.sh 
```

To build docker images on GCP Container Builder, 

```bash
$ ./cloudbuild.sh
```

To run apps in k8s, replace `$PROJECT_ID` with your GCP project ID in `kubernetes.yaml.tmpl`,

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```
